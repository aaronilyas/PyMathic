## Overview  

Welcome to **PyMathic**, an open-source math library designed to provide symbolic computation capabilities in Python. Inspired by SymPy, this library aims to build a solid foundation for algebraic operations, with plans to expand into trigonometry, differential calculus, and integral calculus.  

## About the Author  

Hi, I'm **Aaron Ilyas**, a full-time student at **Rochester Institute of Technology**. This is my first open-source project, and I felt now was the right time to start. As I progress through my math journey, I plan to continuously update **PyMathic** with more advanced features.  

## Project Goals  

- Implement core algebraic functionality.  
- Expand into trigonometry, calculus, and beyond.  
- Ensure efficient and well-structured symbolic computation.  
- Provide a resource that can later integrate into educational tools.  

## Contribution Policy  

At this stage, I will **not** be accepting pull requests until I have established the fundamental parts of the library:  
âœ… **Algebra**  
âœ… **Trigonometry**  
âœ… **Differential & Integral Calculus**  

However, **I welcome feedback** and suggestions! If you have ideas for optimization or refactoring, feel free to reach out.
